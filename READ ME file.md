# **AI Resume Ranking System 🚀**

## **📌 Project Overview**

The **AI Resume Ranking System** is a machine learning-powered web application that helps recruiters **automatically rank resumes** based on a given job description. It utilizes **TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity** to compare resumes with the job description and rank them accordingly. This tool speeds up the hiring process by filtering resumes based on relevance.
